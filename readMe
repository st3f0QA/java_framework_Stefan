Overview
This repository is part of my ongoing journey as a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer.
As I already have experience with writing tests in Cypress(JS), it serves as a personal
learning project where I’m gaining hands-on experience with Java-based automation testing
and refining my skills in designing, implementing, and maintaining automated test suites.
This project is primarily focused on understanding and applying core automation QA
principles and practices, such as test automation frameworks, scripting, and test
validation.

I’ll continue expanding this project with additional techniques, including SQL queries
and other advanced testing strategies, as I work to deepen my expertise in QA automation.

The main objectives of this project are to:

Practice Java as the primary language for creating robust, maintainable test scripts
Build a foundational understanding of automation testing frameworks and techniques
Improve my skills in test validation, data management, and troubleshooting
Experiment with SQL queries and other complementary tools to enhance the test automation
process
This project is intended as a learning exercise, focused on my professional growth in QA
automation. It remains a work in progress as I continue to add features, refine scripts,
explore new techniques.
